## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, threats like viruses, malware, and trojans are pervasive. Despite having robust antivirus and anti-malware software, malicious entities can find ways to bypass real-time protection and infiltrate your system. These threats often operate covertly within your computer's depths. In this article, we aim to guide you through comprehensive steps to check and fortify your operating system against potential infections.

### Motivation

Recently, a friend of mine voiced concerns about their computer being compromised by an unknown entity. This prompted me to write this article, which is geared not only towards computer geeks well-versed in network security but also towards individuals who may not be programming experts. It's crucial to understand that computer security and programming skills are distinct, and this article addresses the former. Let's dive into the world of protecting your computer effectively.

### Is Apple Inherently Safe?

Let's consider a hypothesis: a long-time user of Apple and a long-time user of Windows. Windows users, on occasion, may download cracked or unofficial versions of software, which can expose them to malware and infections. Seeking help online becomes a common practice when their systems are compromised.

Then, Apple users will start laughing at Windows users, what a rotten system, it is really not as good as the Apple system, I will not be poisoned if I use Apple.

#### Why?

On the other hand, Apple adopts a default whitelist system in its approach. Here, the operating system restricts users from opening or downloading files that haven't received explicit approval. While this approach is often touted as safer, it can lead to complications when users attempt to access certain files not officially sanctioned by Apple.

#### Question

This raises a fundamental question: which system can genuinely be considered safe or unsafe? The answer isn't straightforward. Windows provides users with more flexibility, allowing them to open a wide range of files and software. However, this flexibility can expose them to greater risks if they engage in unsafe practices. In contrast, Apple's restrictive approach aims to minimize risks but can limit users' access to legitimate yet unofficial content.

>Most Apple users are really a joke

It's essential to emphasize. The choice of an operating system depends on various factors, including user preferences and requirements. What's crucial is for users of all systems to recognize that no platform is entirely immune to threats. Instead, it's the user's knowledge and security practices that often determine the level of safety in today's digital world.

## Checking Your Network Connections

### Wireshark - Peering into Data Traffic

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a powerful network protocol analyzer. It enables you to inspect data traffic on your network comprehensively. By examining incoming and outgoing packets, you can spot any suspicious or unauthorized network activities.

**Interpreting Wireshark Data:**

When monitoring your network traffic with Wireshark, it's crucial to interpret the data correctly. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **Normal Traffic Patterns:** Under normal circumstances, when your computer is in an idle state, it should receive minimal network traffic. While some background system processes may generate occasional traffic, it should not amount to thousands of packets per second. However, during active internet usage, such as downloading files or browsing websites, an increase in the number of incoming packets is expected and considered normal.

2. **Abnormal Activity:** If you notice an unusually high volume of incoming packets when you're not actively using the internet or running bandwidth-intensive applications, it could be a sign of unauthorized network activity.

3. **Exclusionary Approach:** To determine if the increased traffic is due to an infection or legitimate downloads, consider closing all unnecessary programs and processes one by one. If the excess traffic persists even with all applications closed, it raises suspicion.

Interpreting Wireshark data requires some networking knowledge. If you’re uncertain about what you’re seeing, you can learn Wireshark from tutorials like [Wireshark Masterclass by Chris Greer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW8bTPfXNGdC5Co0VnBK1yVzAwSSphzpJ).

## Scanning Your Ports

Understanding Port Scanning and Its Crucial Role in Network Security

In the vast realm of network security, comprehending the concept of ports and the necessity of scanning them is fundamental. Ports serve as entry points for data to travel in and out of your computer or network. They are like doors, each designed for a specific purpose, whether it's web browsing, email communication, or online gaming.

Here, we delve into the intricacies of ports, their significance, and why scanning them is essential for safeguarding your network.

### The Role of Ports

Imagine your computer as a bustling city with numerous buildings, each serving a distinct function. In this analogy, the city's streets represent your network, and the buildings are the programs or services running on your computer. Ports, then, are the entrances to these buildings, facilitating the flow of data in and out.

Here are some common port numbers and their associated services:

- **Port 80**: This is the default port for HTTP traffic, the protocol used for web browsing. When you visit a website, your browser communicates with the webserver through this port.

- **Port 25**: Reserved for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), it's used for sending email messages.

- **Port 22**: Associated with Secure Shell (SSH), it allows secure remote access to your computer or server.

- **Port 443**: Used for secure HTTPS web connections, commonly seen when accessing banking websites or online shopping.

### Why Scan Your Ports?

1. **Security Assessment**: Port scanning reveals which ports are open and listening for incoming connections. An open port could be a potential vulnerability if it's not needed for your network's operation.

2. **Network Troubleshooting**: Scanning helps identify issues with network services. If a particular service is not working correctly, checking whether its associated port is open can pinpoint the problem.

3. **Intrusion Detection**: It assists in identifying unauthorized access attempts. If someone is trying to gain access to your system, port scanning can detect these intrusion attempts.

4. **Firewall Configuration**: For network administrators, scanning helps in configuring firewalls to permit or deny specific port access, thereby enhancing security.

5. **Service Discovery**: Scanning can be used to discover which services are running on a network. This is especially useful in larger networks with many interconnected devices.

In summary, scanning your ports is a proactive measure to maintain a secure network. By regularly checking which doors are open and ensuring they should be, you can bolster your network's defenses against potential threats.

In the subsequent sections, we'll explore the tools and techniques for conducting port scans and interpreting the results.

### nmap - Network Mapper

[nmap](https://nmap.org/) is a versatile open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. You can employ it to scan your system's ports, providing insights into open and potentially vulnerable ports. This step helps ensure that unauthorized access points are not open for exploitation.

   Example (Windows):
   ```shell
   ipconfig
   ```

   Example (Linux):
   ```shell
   ifconfig
   ```

2. **Use nmap to Scan Your System:** With your IP address in hand, you can now use nmap to scan your system for open ports. Here's an example command to scan common ports on your local machine:

   ```shell
   nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v 127.0.0.1
   ```

   In this command:
   - `-p 1-65535` scans all possible ports.
   - `-T4` sets the scan speed to "Aggressive."
   - `-A` enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
   - `-v` enables verbose output.
   - `127.0.0.1` is the IP address to scan. Replace it with your system's IP address.

3. **Review nmap Results:** After running the nmap scan, carefully review the results. Look for any open ports that you didn't expect or are not related to services you use. If you find any unusual open ports, investigate further to determine if they pose a security risk.
